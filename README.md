# Plane-Crashes-Project

This is my final submission for my CPSC 103 Final Project.

I wanted to know at which stage of flight are plane crashes more prevalent and decided to use this topic for my CPSC 103 project. The style of programming is in the format of "How to Design Functions" method we learned throughout the course. The purpose of this project is to showcase my knowledge on building well-structured and well-written programs in Python at an introductory level. I received 100% on this project.



In the end, I found that the flight phase sees most of the crashes. This is followed by the Takeoff phase.
